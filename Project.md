# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a website using flask or django as a framework that will make managing our www.todoist.com projects and tasks easier to manage. The website will use the todoist API and solve current issues the Worship Arts team at Cherry Hills Church in Springfield IL (www.cherryhillsfamily.org) are experiencing.

# Problems to solve

1. The current todist app and website aren't easy to manage or navigate. We need a user friendly way to quickly view and manage tasks and projects

2. There is no way to assign multiple team members to a task. There must be a way to create and assign a task that notifies multiple people when updates or missed deadlines occure.

3. There is no way to set up a reccurring task that can have a custom name with every recurrence. For example, have a task that updates with a name and then has the due date in the task name as well.

4. There's no way to automatically complete a task after the due take. There should be a way to designate a task to be automitacally closed or completed after the due date. Possibly with a check box during setup. This would be especially helpful with recurring tasks.

# Technical details

This project will use our todist api key. It will be built with python via Flask or Django, whichever is best suited for the project. This site will be werved on Railway.com. There should be a login page and admin page to setup users to the site.
